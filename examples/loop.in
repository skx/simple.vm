# About
#
#  Use a conditional jump to loop ten times, the conditional will trigger
# if a "SUB" operation results in <0.
#
#
# Usage
#
#  $ compiler ./loop.in ; ./simple-vm ./loop.raw
#
#
#

        store #1, "Counting from ten to zero\n"
        print_str #1

        store #1, 11
        store #2, 1
:repeat

        #
        # This means "reg1 = reg1 - reg2"
        #
        sub #1, #1, #2
        print_int #1

        # add newline to the output
        store #5, "\n"
        print_str #5

        #
        # This jump only occur if the zero-flag is set.
        #
        jmpnz repeat


        store #1, "Done\n"
        print_str #1

        exit
