        #  The number of bytes to show is the same as the length
        # of this (compiled) script.
        #
        #  If we store the offset of the "end" label, in register 1,
        # that will correspond to our length.
        #
        store #1, end

        #
        #  We'll loop with offset 1.
        #
        #  i.e. register 1 is the store of iterates.
        #
        #       and each loop we set: reg1 = reg1 - reg2
        #
        #
        store #2, 1

        #
        #  Address to show
        #
        store #3, 0

:repeat
        #
        #  Get the contents of the byte and show it
        #
        peek #5, #3
        print_int #5

        #
        #  Increase to show the next address.
        #
        inc #3

        #
        #  Show some spacing.
        #
        store #5, " "
        print_str #5

        #
        #  Loop until we're done.

        #
        #  Terminate with a newline.

        #  DATA - just for fun.
