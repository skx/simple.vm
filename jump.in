#
# About
#
#  This program only outputs some static strings and an integer
#
#  However it does prove that the goto/label handling is correct.
#
#
# Usage
#
#  $ compiler ./jump.in ; ./simple-vm ./jump.raw
#
#
#

        store #1, "Steve Kemp"
        print_str #1
        goto number

        # padding here - just for amusement.
        nop
        exit

:kirsi
        store #1, "Kirsi Kemp"
        print_str #1
        exit

:number
        store #1, 32
        print_int #1
        goto kirsi
